# Car Image Classification
*Note : Please run all the `.ipynb` notebooks in an environment with a GPU as this will make the code run faster than running than running it directly on the CPU. The dataset is from https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html. I used the dataset available in kaggle, it is the same thing but directly available.*

### Repository Structure
- `Fine_Tuning`
  - Contains all the `.ipynb` notebooks with model that was trained use the Fine Tuning transfer method
  - The pretrained models here are :
    - `ResNet34`
    - `VGG16`
    - `DenseNet`
- `Feature_Extraction`
  - Contains all the `.ipynb` notebooks with model that was trained use the Feature Extraction transfer method
  - The pretrained models here are :
    - `ResNet34`
    - `VGG16`
    - `DenseNet`
